// Coding Challenge #2
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice outputto the console,saying who hast hehigherBMI.The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. UseatemplateliteraltoincludetheBMIvaluesintheoutputs.Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
